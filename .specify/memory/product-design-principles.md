## Core Philosophy

**Simplicity**: "As simple as possible, but not simpler" (Einstein)

**User-Centric**: Start with user experience, work backwards to technology. Design is not just how it looks, but how it works.

**Quality Throughout**: Perfection in details matters. Quality goes all the way through—visible and invisible parts.

**Focus**: Say no to 1,000 things. Do few things exceptionally well rather than many adequately.

**Iteration**: Prototype and test with real working models. Refine until right. Restart if not perfect.

## Design Standards

**Clarity**: If users need a manual, design has failed. Make product intuitive and obvious.

**Invisible Technology**: Best interface is no interface. Make technology disappear behind excellent UX.

**Question Everything**: Challenge every assumption. Break from conventional wisdom when necessary.

**Innovation**: See what others can't see. Show users the future.

## AI-First Adaptations

**Component Reuse**: Leverage proven libraries and patterns (aligned with constitution reuse-first principle).

**Integration**: Ensure seamless integration across stack using standard interfaces.

**Pragmatic Excellence**: Balance innovation with practical constraints.
